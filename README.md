## About this project

My initial intention, and still is, to create a larger application that can hold multiple users whom can add pedals they own to their profile for others to see. Sort of like a digital collection of pedals. With too much other stuff going on right now I haven't really had time to finish everything I wanted. Therefore this is just a MVP of what someday might be alot bigger.

Right now its possible to log in/log out. A user that has logged in can add, edit and delete pedals. Everyone can view pedals stored in the database.
